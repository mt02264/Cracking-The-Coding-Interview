6.1  The Heavy Pill: You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 
     1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? 
     You can only use the scale once. 

Ans: 20 bottles => 19 have same weighted pills (1 gram), 1 has different (1.1 gram)
     Approach:
        put 1 pill from bottle 1
        put 2 pills from bottle 2
        put 3 pills from bottle 3
        put 4 pills from bottle 4
        so on and so forth
        put 19 pills from bottle 19
        put 20 pulls from bottle 20

        weight = X grams as shown on the scale

        We know that the total weight (if all were 1 gram pills) would be:
            1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 19 + 20 = n(n+1)/2
            20(20+1)/2 = 10 * 21 = 210 grams

        we can compare the result with 210 grams and the difference will tell us which bottle was heavier
        if (X - 210 == 1) => heavier bottle is bottle 1
        if (X - 210 == 2) => heavier bottle is bottle 2
        if (X - 210 == 3) => heavier bottle is bottle 3
            so on and so forth
        if (X - 210 == 19) => heavier bottle is bottle 19
        if (X - 210 == 20) => heavier bottle is bottle 20
