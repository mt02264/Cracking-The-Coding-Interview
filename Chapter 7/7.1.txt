7.1 - Deck of Cards: Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would 
subclass the data structures to implement blackjack. 

Ans: 
        generic deck of cards has following properties

        class Cards(){
            name : 1 - 52,
            suit : spades - diamonds - hearts - queen - clubs
        }
        class Deck (){
            constructor(){
                this.cardsList = [];
                // loop over 52 to add 52 cards with their values in the list
            }
            getDeck(){
                return this.cardsList;
            }
        }
